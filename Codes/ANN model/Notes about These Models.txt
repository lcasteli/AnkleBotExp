Here are some notes about those ANN models:

1. Those models include models in both DP and IE directions (See the file names), based on data from 0.7 to 8 Hz.

2. Each model file includes 6 files:
a. net -- ANN models
b. info -- information about models, like regression.
c. output -- output from the model according to input to train the model.
d. error -- errors between the results of model and targets (data from experiments).
e. input -- input to the model
f. target -- target to the model (data from experiments) 

3. The model may predict both magnitude and phase of impedance.

Let me know if you have further questions.
